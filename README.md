Hey all, Vincenzo Aleskey Brocato (VinceAle7082) here! <br>
This is a little project where I try to make an OS just for fun <br>
<br>
<h3>
  
  ***What exacly is XanvicOS?***
</h3>
<br>
XanvicOS is a little project written by me when I have time to. I want to create an os that can run 16, 32 and 64 bit binaries, in future there will be a package manager, and in some time maybe even linux binaries support. <br>
I also want to create a windows manager with some features that I like. If you want to help, you can. <br>

<h3>
  ***Why are there 2 branches?***
</h3>
<br>
The Stable branch is the branch where I push the "mega commits" with working code, adding features to XanvicOS (or how do you want to call it). <br>
I don't like writing code for hours, days and then push the commit, so I chose to use the main branch as the Coding branch, where I commit more actively, but the code is unfinished, so it may contain a lot of bugs and errors, or simply doesn't compile. <br>
If you want to try XanvicOS, use the Stable branch.<br>
If you wanna help to write code, contribute to the main branch <br>
<br>
<br>
PS:if I wrote something wrong, sorry, English isn't my first language.
