Hey all, Vincenzo Aleskey Brocato (VinceAle7082) here! <br>
This is a little project where I try to make an OS just for fun <br>
<br>
<h3>
  
  What exacly is XanvicOS?
</h3>
<br>
XanvicOS is a little project written by me when I have time to. I want to create an os that can run 16, 32 and 64 bit binaries, in future there will be a package manager, and in some time maybe even linux binaries support. <br>
I also want to create a windows manager with some features that I like. If you want to help, you can. <br>

<h3>
  Why are there 2 branches?
</h3>
<br>
The main branch is the branch where I commit all of my work, but it can be ful of bugs, dosn't compile, or both. <br>
I created the stable branch so someone can try XanvicOS, without worring if the code compiles or not. <br>
It's like mainline and stable linux kernels, only that, how I already said before, the main branch may not compile.<br>
If you want to try XanvicOS, clone the stable branch, if you want to contribute, use the main one. <br>
<br>

PS:if I wrote something wrong, sorry, English isn't my first language.
