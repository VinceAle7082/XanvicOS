Hey all, Vincenzo Aleskey Brocato (VinceAle7082) here! <br>
This is a little project where I try to make an OS just for fun <br>
<br>
**What is XanvicOS?**
<hr>
XanvicOS is the name of this OS, I'll try to make an OS with a 16 and 64 bit mode (like the Windows 9x series, excluding Windows ME). <hr>
In this OS will be possible to run natively linux executables, and there will be a source-based package manager (like Gentoo GNU/Linux's portage) <hr>
<br>
**What can I do to help you?**
<hr>
You can fix issues, help me find a better name, add features to the kernel...
<br>

PS: if I wrote something wrong, sorry, English isn't my first language.
