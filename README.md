Hey all, Vincenzo Aleskey Brocato (VinceAle7082) here! <br>
This is a little project where I try to explore OS developing just for fun!<br>
<br>
<h3>
  What exactly is XanvicOS?
</h3>
<br>
XanvicOS is a little project that I write when I have free time. I want to create an os that can run 16, 32 and 64 bit binaries, in future I hope I might be able to add a package manager, and in even more time maybe even linux binaries support. <br>
I also want to create a windows manager with some features that I like that I'll call SunShineWM. If you want to help, you can. <br>

<h3>
  Why are there 2 branches?
</h3>
<br>
The main branch is the branch where I push my commits, but it can be full of bugs, doesn't compile, or even both. <br>
I created the stable branch so someone can try XanvicOS, without worring if the code compiles or not. <br>
Basically stable=normal, main=developement<br>
If you want to try XanvicOS, clone the stable branch, if you want to contribute, use the main one. <br>
Features will be added to the stable branch after the main one<br>
<br>

  How to compile XanvicOS?
