Hey all, Vincenzo Aleskey Brocato (VinceAle7082) here! <br>
This is a little project where I try to make an OS just for fun <br>
<br>

<h3>
  
  ***What exacly is XanvicOS?***
</h3>
<hr>
XanvicOS is the development name for this OS (the final name will be something like TearOS or SunShine OS), I'll try to make an OS with a 16 and 64 bit mode (like the Windows 9x series, excluding Windows ME). <hr>
In this OS will be possible to run natively linux executables, and there will be a source-based package manager (like Gentoo GNU/Linux's portage) <hr>

<h3>
  
  ***Hwo can I contribute to this project?***
</h3>
<hr>
You can fix issues, help me find a better name, add features to the kernel and other things, just add something to this project ;)

<h3>
  
  ***Why are there 2 branches?***
</h3>
<hr>
The main branch is the branch where I push the "mega commits" with working code, adding features to XanvicOS (or how do you want to call it). <hr>
I don't like writing code for hours, days and then push the commit and write a lot, so I chose to create the Coding branch, where I commit more actively, but the code is unfinished, so it may contain a lot of bugs and errors, or simply doesn't compile. <hr>
If you want to try XanvicOS, use the main branch.

PS: if I wrote something wrong, sorry, English isn't my first language.
