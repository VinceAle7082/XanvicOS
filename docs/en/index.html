    <h2>Welcome to the Xanvico's archive!</h2>
    <h3>Why does this website exist?</h3>
    I created this website because I wanted to.
    <h3>What you'll be using this website for?</h3>
    I'll use this website the things that I do. 
    <h3>What exacly is Xanvico and XanvicOS?</h3>
    Xanvico is the name of our frind group.
    <br>
    XanvicOS is the operative system that we're working and I'll not use an existing kernel like the Linux or BSD ones because I hate my life.
    <br>
    The operative system will be a DOS like system that supports the x86_64 architecture that will  execute 16,32 and 64 bit executable and the GNU/Linux (and if I can do it) and Windows ones.
    <br>
    In the future we'll think about developing source based package manager (like Gentoo's portage).
    <br>
    A GUI will be added in future (I hope it'll be a tiling window manager with some additions).
