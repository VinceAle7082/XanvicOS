# What we want

XanvicOS is this little project that I write because I want to explore OS developing, and maybe make some friends.
So, I want that everyone in this project we'll respect each other, because without respect nothing can be done.
This project isn't nothing serius, just a hobby project.

# Here is what you can't do

## Violate the license

XanvicOS has a license, the GPLv3 license. If has been chosen by the author of something, it has been chosen for a reason. If you violate it you don't respect the idea of the creator about his code.
So, in respec of the author, don't violate it.

## Violate the Code of Conduct

Pretty much for the same reason as the license: it exist, it has been chosen, please respect the author and what he wants.

## Hurt and/or harass someone

If you don't understand why, we DON'T need more people like you. As I already wrote in "What we want", we need to respect each other, so let's do it, no?

## Do something stupid

"Doing something stupid" means a lot, by don't knowing what you are doing, to commit crimes. But it doesn't mean you can't make some errors here and there, we are humans after all.

# Here is what you need to do

## Respect each other

As I already said, this project is built off the idea of respecting each other while contributing. Without respect nothing can be done.

## Don't troll (too much)

You can make some trolls, but you can't make like 100 pull request about deleting all the code and call it "modernize the code"

## Think before doing

Self-explenatory, before doing something, think about what can be done better. If you can't think of anything better, then do it
